*A 3-Lane Runner Game about Racing Against Deadlines*  
## Game Overview

**Run for Your DDL** is a fast-paced runner game where you play as a stressed USYD student racing against endless deadlines.  
Switch between three lanes, collect **time tokens**, and dodge falling **DDL obstacles**.  
Survive long enough to finish your assignments and prove you can beat the clock.

## Gameplay

- Use keyboard arrows to switch lanes:  
  - `←` Move Left  
  - `→` Move Right  
- Collect **time tokens** to increase your score.  
- Avoid **obstacles (DDL fragments)** — hitting one means you’ve failed your assignment.  
- When you collect 66 time tokens, a message appears:  
  **"You finished your DDL! 🎉"**

After losing, you can choose:
- **Continue** to play again  
- **Quit** to exit the game
